Exception handling is synonymous with error handling. This gives us the ability
to tell our program how to handle certain exceptions as they arise,
which is important because errors are bound to happen when programs
interact with the real world. We use this to control the execution flow
and prevent the program from exiting or haulting entirely in the case of an error.
